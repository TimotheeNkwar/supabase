        "read_time": 12,
        "content": '''
            ## Introduction
            Time series forecasting is a critical component of data science, enabling businesses to predict future trends based on historical data. Feature engineering plays a pivotal role in enhancing the accuracy of forecasting models by extracting meaningful patterns from temporal data. In this tutorial, we explore advanced techniques such as lag variables, rolling statistics, and seasonal decomposition to improve model performance.

            ## Lag Variables
            Lag variables capture the relationship between a data point and its previous values, allowing models to account for temporal dependencies. For example, in sales forecasting, the sales from the previous day or week can be strong predictors.

            import pandas as pd

            # Create lag features
            def create_lag_features(df, column, lags=[1, 2, 3]):
                for lag in lags:
                    df[f'{column}_lag_{lag}'] = df[column].shift(lag)
                return df

            # Example usage
            data = pd.DataFrame({'sales': [100, 120, 130, 140, 150]})
            data = create_lag_features(data, 'sales', lags=[1, 2])
            print(data)

            ## Rolling Statistics
            Rolling statistics, such as moving averages or standard deviations, smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends. These features are particularly useful for noisy time series data.

            # Create rolling mean and standard deviation
            def create_rolling_features(df, column, windows=[3, 7]):
                for window in windows:
                    df[f'{column}_roll_mean_{window}'] = df[column].rolling(window=window).mean()
                    df[f'{column}_roll_std_{window}'] = df[column].rolling(window=window).std()
                return df

            # Example usage
            data = create_rolling_features(data, 'sales', windows=[3])
            print(data)

            ## Seasonal Decomposition
            Seasonal decomposition separates a time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. This technique helps models focus on specific patterns, such as recurring seasonal effects.

            from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose

            # Decompose time series
            result = seasonal_decompose(data['sales'], model='additive', period=7)
            data['trend'] = result.trend
            data['seasonal'] = result.seasonal
            data['residual'] = result.resid
            print(data)

            ## Conclusion
            By incorporating lag variables, rolling statistics, and seasonal decomposition, data scientists can significantly enhance the predictive power of time series models. These techniques, when combined with robust machine learning algorithms, enable accurate forecasting for diverse applications.
